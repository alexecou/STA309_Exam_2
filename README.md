This repository holds the files pertaining to the STA309 Exam 2 assignment done in RStudio.

The first half of this project looks at data covering dairy production and consumption around the world. With this information, I have created a dashboard with five different plots.

The first two plots are maps showing global consumption and production in the year 2021 specifically, as that is the most recent year the data had. On these maps, the consumption and the production of the United States is highlighted. Then, looking at the US closer, two plots covering from 1961 to 2021 were made, one showing US consumption over time, and the other showing US production over time. From these two we see that production has steadily increased in the US, but dairy consumption has actually been steadily declining over time. The last plot is a relational plot, showing the relationship between US dairy production and consumption.

The second half of this project looks at two different Taylor Swift songs and does a sentiment analysis on both. Then, a plot was created showing the different proportion of negative sentiments to positive sentiments between the two songs. 

The following packages were used to complete this assignment:
tidyverse, ggthemes, maps, ggplot2, dplyr, patchwork, scales
